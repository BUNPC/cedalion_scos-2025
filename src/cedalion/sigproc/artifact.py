    """Identify motion artifacts in an fNIRS input data array.

    If any active data channel exhibits a signal change greater than std_thresh or
    amp_thresh, then a segment of data around that time point is marked 
    as a motion artifact.

    INPUTS:
    amplitudes:     NDTimeSeries, input fNIRS data array with at least time and channel
                    dimensions. Expectation is raw or optical density data.
    t_motion:       Quantity, time in seconds for motion artifact detection. Checks for
                    signal change indicative of a motion artifact over time range t_motion.
    t_mask:         Quantity, time in seconds to mask around motion artifacts. Mark data
                    over +/- tMask seconds around the identified motion artifact as a
                    motion artifact.
    stdev_thresh:   Quantity, threshold for std deviation of signal change. If the
                    signal d for any given active channel changes by more that
                    stdev_thresh * stdev(d) over the time interval tMotion, then this
                    time point is marked as a motion artifact. The standard deviation
                    is determined for each channel independently. Typical value ranges
                    from 5 to 20. Use a value of 100 or greater if you wish for this
                    condition to not find motion artifacts.
    amp_thresh:     Quantity, threshold for amplitude of signal change. If the signal d
                    for any given active channel changes by more that amp_thresh over
                    the time interval tMotion, then this time point is marked as a
                    motion artifact. Typical value ranges from 0.01 to 0.3 for optical
                    density units. Use a value greater than 100 if you wish for this
                    condition to not find motion artifacts.
    global_flag:    Boolean, flag to indicate whether identified motion artefacts in each
                    channel should be masked per channel or globally across channels.

    OUTPUS:
    channel_mask:   is an xarray that has at least the dimensions channel and time,
                    units are boolean. At each time point, "true" indicates  data
                    included and "false" indicates motion artifacts.

    PARAMETERS:
    t_motion: 0.5
    t_mask: 1.0
    stdev_thresh: 50.0
    amp_thresh: 5.0
    global_flag: False
