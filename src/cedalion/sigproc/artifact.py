    INPUTS:
    amplitudes:     NDTimeSeries, input fNIRS data array with at least time and channel dimensions. 
                    Expectation is data in optical density units.
    tMotion:        Quantity, time in seconds for motion artifact detection. Checks for signal change indicative
                    of a motion artifact over time range tMotion. 
    tMask:          Quantity, time in seconds to mask around motion artifacts. Mark data over +/- tMask seconds 
                    around the identified motion artifact as a motion artifact. 
    STDEVthresh:    Quantity, threshold for std deviation of signal change. If the signal d for any given active 
                    channel changes by more that stdev_thresh * stdev(d) over the time interval tMotion, then
                    this time point is marked as a motion artifact. The standard deviation is determined for 
                    each channel independently. Typical value ranges from 5 to 20. Use a value of 100 or greater 
                    if you wish for this condition to not find motion artifacts.
    AMPthresh:      Quantity, threshold for amplitude of signal change. If the signal d for any given active channel 
                    changes by more that amp_thresh over the time interval tMotion, then this time point is marked 
                    as a motion artifact. Typical value ranges from 0.01 to 0.3 for optical density units. 
                    Use a value greater than 100 if you wish for this condition to not find motion artifacts.

    OUTPUS: 
    fNIRSdata:      NDTimeSeries, input fNIRS data array with an additional dimension "artefact_mask" that is a boolean
                    array with "true" for data included and "false" to indicate motion artifacts.

    PARAMETERS:
    tMotion: 0.5
    tMask: 1.0
    STDEVthresh: 50.0
    AMPthresh: 5.0
